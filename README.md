# STM2SNES Cartridge

## Overview
The STM2SNES Cartridge is a homebrew cartridge designed and developed with a STM32 core for SNES homebrew applications. This cartridge aims to provide a modern and flexible solution for interfacing with SNES hardware without the need for FPGAs.

## Features
- **STM32 Core:** Utilizes a powerful STM32 microcontroller for enhanced performance.
- **No FPGA Required:** Simplified design, making it more accessible for homebrew.
- **Full Pin Usage:** Unlike other solutions, this cartridge makes use of all 62 pins, providing maximum compatibility and functionality, and is specifically designed to support homebrew and extend hardware functionalities.
